This is where I solved problems. 

1. Click Me! button for H1 did not work. It did not work because script in the
    HTML files was mispelled has scrip instead of script. 

2. Metoo text was orginal did not work becuase it was place benith the script element.
    It needed to be placed above the script element because js was running before the element was read. 

3. userName input did not properly work because .value was missing which gets the value stored. 

4. After clicking add number did not display since there was mismatch between id tags for results. Corrected name mismatch fix the issue. 

5. Multiply equation only returned 0 since the global value was read when the page loaded. 
    Either read the varible in the listener or Numbers(.value) inside the function, additionall 
    without Number() and only .value the number will combined as strings values.
