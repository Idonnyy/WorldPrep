Step 1: Identify what the problem asks

Ask yourself one simple question:

Are you visiting items just to do something with them? → Traversal

Are you combining values into one number/result? → Accumulation

Are you looking for something (existence, first match)? → Search

Are you creating a new array/object based on old data? → Transformation

Step 2: Pick your loop blueprint
Traversal: just loop + action (like console.log)
Accumulation: initialize accumulator + loop + add to it accumulator
Search: loop + condition + break if found
Transformation: create new array + loop + push modified value

“Do I need to combine, transform, search, or traverse?”
